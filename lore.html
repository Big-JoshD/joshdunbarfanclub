    <h1>Josh Dunbar Lore</h1>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>
    <h2 class="section-title">Backstory</h2>
    <p>
      Born beneath a blood moon in a remote mountain monastery, Josh Dunbar entered the world with a jawline foretold in ancient prophecy.
      Raised by retired powerlifters and rogue chess grandmasters, he trained in silence — his only companion: a loyal pup named Bean.
    </p>
    <p>
      By age 6, Josh could deadlift a full size sedan. By age 9, he could outwit local elders in strategy games.
      And by 12, his right bicep was declared a minor landmark by three separate cartographers.
    </p>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>
    <h2 class="section-title">Current Endeavors</h2>
    <p>
      Josh’s mornings begin with <strong>silent cold plunges</strong> in mountain-fed basins, followed by a ritual walk through a gym that no longer charges him. 
      Not because he refuses — but because the staff feels it would be wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      His presence alone has become a catalyst for greatness. PRs fall like dominoes when he enters the room. Spotters pause mid-rep to watch. 
      Mirrors tilt subtly toward him. Some say a 315 bench press feels like 275 when he’s nearby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the divine aura, Josh remains impossibly humble. He never corrects form — yet form corrects itself in his proximity. 
      He offers no advice, only nods. And those nods have <em>rewired destinies</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some followers claim that the gym lights flicker when he exhales deeply. Others believe he walks with the posture of a monk and the silence of a king.
    </p>
    <p>
      And though he rarely speaks, his reverence has created a following. One does not simply train in the same hour as Josh — one <strong>participates in ritual</strong>.
    </p>

    <section class="content-box">

    <div class="lore-entry">
      <h2>The Benchpress Prophecy</h2>
      <p>
        Lifters in solitude have reported hearing a low voice behind them in their final rep:
        “One more.”
        No one is there. But the rep is always completed. 
        We believers know it is the spirit of Josh.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="lore-entry">
      <h2>The Time He Fought a Mirror</h2>
      <p>
        Legend tells of the day Josh caught his own reflection flexing out of turn. The ensuing standoff lasted seven days,
        ending only when the mirror cracked and whispered, “You win.”
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="lore-entry">
      <h2>The Dumbbell That Cried</h2>
      <p>
        Witnesses claim Josh once lifted a 150-pound dumbbell with such gentleness, it wept chrome tears and asked to be held again.
        The dumbbell has since retired and resides in a museum.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="lore-entry">
      <h2>The Whispered Spotter</h2>
      <p>
        In the darkest corners of unlit gyms, some say they hear Josh’s voice—softly saying, "You’ve got this."
        Believers always complete the rep.
