      <h2>Josh vs. Chuck Norris: Explained by My Dad</h2>
      <p>I once asked my dad who would win in a fight: Josh Dunbar or Chuck Norris. He didn’t laugh. He didn’t answer. He just stared into his coffee and quietly said, “We don’t ask that question twice.” This is what he told me:</p>
      <p>Some say Chuck Norris roundhouse kicked a mountain in half. Josh once did a hammer curl so powerful, the mountain folded itself out of respect.</p>
      <p>When Chuck enters a room, people applaud. When Josh enters a room, the Earth's gravitational pull is lessened.</p>
      <p>A meteor once changed course to avoid Earth. Not because of chance. Because Josh looked up.</p>
      <p>They say thunder is just the sky imitating Josh’s warmup set.</p>
      <p>Chuck Norris doesn’t challenge Josh. Not out of fear — but out of respect.</p>

      <h2>The Voice on Rep Eleven</h2>
      <p>I had just come off a double overtime. Mandatory. Eighteen hours on my feet, fueled by nothing but two Ghosts, a white Monster, and vending machine protein bars.</p>
      <p>But I still went to the gym. I had to. I’ve got Josh’s physique saved on my lock screen. You don’t skip days when you’re trying to sculpt a Greek statue.</p>
      <p>It was 3:00AM. The gym was empty; not even the cleaning staff were up that late. But I still felt this compulsion to lift. Some call it discipline, others call it madness. Me? I’m just trying to be like my hero.</p>
      <p>I was running on fumes. I had no business attempting a heavy bench press that night. But something in me said go for eleven.<br/>Rep ten was a battle. Rep eleven was a war.</p>
      <p>The bar started sinking. I could feel the weight slowly descending toward my neck. My life didn’t flash before my eyes — just his biceps.</p>
      <p>Then I heard it.<br/>Clear. Calm. Right in my ear:<br/><strong><em>“You’ve got this.”</em></strong></p>
      <p>My arms locked. My chest exploded with power I didn't have.<br/>The bar rose like it would have been ashamed to fall in front of <strong>him</strong>.</p>
      <p>I didn’t see anyone. But I felt… presence. Like the air had become aware of itself.<br/>I finished the rep. Smooth. Controlled. Divine.</p>
      <p>When I racked it, the gym was still empty. Except for the faint smell of iron and—no joke—campfire and cedar.</p>
      <p>I don’t care if no one believes me.<br/>Josh was there. And I lift differently now.</p>

      <h2>The Day I Saw Him</h2>
      <p>I’d just joined the gym two weeks ago. I was still learning how to use the machines. I didn’t even know how to properly rack weights. I was honestly getting discouraged, and was about ready to quit.</p>
      <p>Then I saw him.</p>
      <p>He walked in with no earbuds. No entourage. Just an oversized hoodie and a look of complete serenity. He nodded once at the front desk. The music got quieter.</p>
      <p><strong>Josh Dunbar.</strong></p>
      <p>I didn’t even know his name then. But I felt it. Everyone did. The regulars nodded at him like monks acknowledging a higher order.</p>
      <p>He didn’t look at me. He didn’t need to. He just stood by the dumbbell rack — and somehow, my posture fixed itself. My shoulders squared. My breath slowed. I put down the 15s and picked up the 25s.</p>
      <p>I PR’d that day. On accident.</p>
      <p>I haven’t missed a session since.</p>
