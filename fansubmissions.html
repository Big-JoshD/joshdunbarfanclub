  <h2>Josh vs. Chuck: A Thought Experiment</h2>
  <p>
    I once asked my dad who would win in a fight: Josh Dunbar or Chuck Norris.  
    He didn’t laugh. He didn’t answer. He just stared into his coffee and quietly said,  
    “We don’t ask that question twice.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Some say Chuck Norris roundhouse kicked a mountain in half.  
    Josh once did a hammer curl so powerful, the mountain folded itself out of respect.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Chuck enters a room, people applaud.  
    When Josh enters a room, gravity takes a break to watch.
  </p>
  <p>
    There’s a reason Chuck hasn’t issued a challenge.  
    He knows. We all know.
