      <h2>Josh vs. Chuck Norris: Explained by My Dad</h2>
      <p>
        I once asked my dad who would win in a fight: Josh Dunbar or Chuck Norris.  
        He didn’t laugh. He didn’t answer. He just stared into his coffee and quietly said,  
        “We don’t ask that question twice.” This is what he told me:
      </p>
      <p>
        Some say Chuck Norris roundhouse kicked a mountain in half.  
        Josh once did a hammer curl so powerful, the mountain folded itself out of respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Chuck enters a room, people applaud.  
        When Josh enters a room, the Earth's gravitational pull is lessened.
      </p>
      <p>
        A meteor once changed course to avoid Earth.  
        Not because of chance. Because Josh looked up.
      </p>
      <p>
        They say thunder is just the sky imitating Josh’s warmup set.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chuck Norris doesn’t challenge Josh.  
        Not out of fear — but out of respect.

      <h2>The Voice on Rep Eleven</h2>
      <p>
        I had just come off a double overtime. Mandatory. Eighteen hours on my feet, fueled by nothing but two Ghosts, a white Monster, and vending machine protein bars.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I still went to the gym. I had to. I’ve got Josh’s physique saved on my lock screen. You don’t skip days when you’re trying to sculpt a Greek statue.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was 3:00AM. The gym was empty; not even the cleaning staff were up that late. But I still felt this compulsion to lift.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rep ten was a battle. Rep eleven was a war. The bar began to sink — my life didn’t flash before my eyes… just his biceps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I heard it: <strong><em>"You’ve got this."</em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        My arms locked. My chest exploded with power I didn't have. The bar rose like it would’ve been ashamed to fall in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn’t see anyone. But I felt… presence. Like the air had become aware of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I finished the rep. Smooth. Controlled. Divine.

      <h2>The Day I Saw Him</h2>
      <p>
        I’d just joined the gym two weeks ago. I didn’t even know how to properly rack weights. I was honestly getting discouraged, ready to quit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I saw him. No earbuds. No entourage. Just an oversized hoodie and a look of complete serenity. He nodded once at the front desk. The music got quieter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Josh Dunbar.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn’t know his name yet. But I felt it. Everyone did.  
        The regulars nodded like monks acknowledging a higher order.
      </p>
      <p>
        He didn’t look at me. He didn’t need to.  
        He stood by the dumbbell rack — and somehow, my posture fixed itself. The 15's felt like 5's.
      </p>
      <p>
        I PR’d that day. On accident.

  <h2>Celebrity Testimonies</h2>

  <p><strong>Greg Doucette:</strong><br/>
    “Josh Dunbar taught me to train harder than fricken last time — and then harder than that.”
  </p>

  <p><strong>Chris Bumstead:</strong><br/>
    “I’m just thankful he’s not allowed to compete. Classic Physique couldn’t survive him.”
  </p>

  <p><strong>Donald J. Trump:</strong><br/>
    “Josh Dunbar is what makes America great. Very strong, very smart. People are talking about it.”
  </p>

  <p><strong>Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson:</strong><br/>
    “I invited Josh to a cheat meal once. He ate the plate. I haven’t challenged him since.”
  </p>

  <p><strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger:</strong><br/>
    “He is the embodiment of mass with class. If I were to sculpt Mr. Olympia from scratch… it would still fall short.”
  </p>

  <p><strong>Elon Musk:</strong><br/>
    “Josh isn’t from this planet. I’ve checked.”
  </p>

  <p><strong>Gordon Ramsay:</strong><br/>
    “He doesn’t cook. He just flexes and the steak reverse-sears itself.”
  </p>

  <p><strong>David Goggins:</strong><br/>
    “I ran 100 miles to escape the aura of Josh’s power. He was already waiting at the finish line.”
  </p>

  <p><strong>Ryan Reynolds:</strong><br/>
    “He’s like Deadpool without the healing factor. But still can’t be killed.”
